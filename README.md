## Woah check out those mad programming skills

Had to exclude some repos where I included some libraries cuz I mean I don't actually write that much code and it was like 99% Python, which is okay, but I definitely am not only a Python dev or whatever or a dev at all in fact you know. 
I know Rust is a language.
